# Thinking React

You may hear this term occasionally, "Thinking React", but what does it mean?
In general, thinking React is to think of the application your making as a
collection of components.  Each component you make serves a purpose in the
larger scale of the application that is being served.

For instance if you are creating a counter application your overall application
is one component, The buttons that add or subtract would be another component,
and the element that displays the current value would be another.
